As a content strateger my purpose is to lead consumer behavior and tendencies to reduce psychologycal and energetic disorders such as rush, crazy, bored, lazy, that could lead to physical states such as "bald" "skinny" or "fat" that cause emotional distress and reduce the amount of individuals who make it to ideal physical states such as "pretty" "handsome" "strong". 

Understanding how our networked subscriptions continiously use data to engage attention span allows for users to locate in-stances where content subscription is supposed to lead to new tendency.

Not being able to locate such instances compounds energy sequences and creates strain which delay responses & reactions that result in memory loss or "memento"

One of the goals at "Percept Connect" is to create content strategy that allows for algorhythms to enable users the ability to use cellular data to locate experiences where common relation exists and the assiilation of personality traits can lead to insights.
ie: Facebook software engineer uses his or her use of popular media or content to understand personality mode stances to led, preferences or correlation and social activities to progress them.

A goal at percept connect is to allow for subscribers of unlimited data to locate experiences as advertised in conent which produced prosocial emotional reaction or realization as they lead to an occupation or task of compensation.

Once experience of value has been located and proper attention span must be applied, in-stances which lead to emotional debilitating behavior due to interactions with elements or energy in a profound manner physical states such as "tremble"ugly"skinny"fat"bald"   

tremble is state in which forth hence energy is not present

Text message data and networking behavior is not correlated to binging and data that is watched.

At this lack of correlation going to work or school becomes a complacent destination based on the variance in kines energy and lack of content relation.

The cause for complacency is due to user being more intensely in tune to visual, auditory non active electromagnetic experience than when at work or school and reading static or printed text to use hand eye cordination and write or interpret

Sense interaction and relation with content is greater than interest in work or school occupation 

Content is acquired through kines electromagnetic screen or tactile contextual method which results to attention span decrease as consumer goes from worker to user.

Smartphone data is to be used to lead behaviors and tendencies out of screens in tune prior to acquisition of smartphone.
